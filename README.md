# Scraping Medium with this Repository


To use this scraper to collect your own data, you simply have to clone this repository to your local drive, then acquire a few more tools to make the scraper work. 

First you will need to download the <a href="http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads">Chrome Driver</a> and place it in the same directory as the "scrape_master.py" and "medium_scraper.py" files. You will also need the following Python libraries you will need: Selenium, Pandas, BeautifulSoup.

Before you can run the scraper, you need to specify the tags and range-of-dates to scrape in the "scrape_master.py" file.
